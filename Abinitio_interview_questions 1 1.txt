4) input table (roll no, marks, subject) we need output as (roll no, sum of marks)
5)above question but we want all subject id also in same output row for which marks sum is calculated.
6)we want all roll no, marks and in last line we want sum of all marks. How can we do that?

support & dev exp segregation asked by Gowtham
opening the graph - from scratch dev
explained his profile well
Informatica vs AbInitio comparison - how A>I will prove better than Informatica - answered on parallelism - dynamic artifact generation - volume of data
PBE vs FBE
Optimizing the graph without knowing why the existing graph is built that way - MFS - avoid using multiple Sort
IP file(transaction) - RFMT - Sort - FBE - Scan - PBRR - RLP(total transactions per country) - MFS - issue with the designs - (PBRR answered) (FBE at start of graph, answered) (partitioning data earlier answered)
Data skewing impact on above if PBK is used - okish
cust id, transaction id, product purchased, etc - it is MFS partitioned on cust_id - lkp has product id, product deatils, product description - 10 million in input, 10 in lkp - lkp_local on hint he agreed
FBE - (1+1)==10 - 1==-1 - answered right
1|10|3 (avging based on no of non empty columns) - answered vector and all
